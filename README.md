# Practice Repository: C Programming

Welcome to my practice repository for C programming! This repository serves as a sandbox for honing my skills in this fundamental programming language. Created as part of my coursework with Phitron, this repository is a testament to my dedication to mastering C.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to practice and enhance my understanding of C programming concepts. By working on diverse projects and exercises, I aim to strengthen my grasp on:

- Syntax and semantics of C.
- Data structures and algorithms implemented in C.
- Memory management techniques.
- Best practices and coding standards.
